# How to Do ANOVA Calculations by Hand

A collection of step-by-step guides and worked examples for computing **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** by hand — without relying on built-in software functions.  
This repository is ideal for students, instructors, and anyone who wants to **understand the mechanics behind ANOVA calculations**.

## 📌 What’s in This Repo

Each file walks through different ANOVA scenarios:

- **1-way ANOVA (balanced & unbalanced)** – Manual computation of sums of squares, degrees of freedom, mean squares, and F-statistic.
- **2-way ANOVA (various designs)** – Between-subjects, within-subjects, with/without replicates.
- **3-way ANOVA** – Extensions to multiple factors.
- **Nested ANOVA**
- **Mixed-design ANOVA** (between & within)
- **Randomized block designs**
- **Fisher LSD (post-hoc test)**
- **ANCOVA (analysis of covariance)**

👉 Each document contains the formulas, explanation of steps, and worked examples.

> These guides focus on **manual calculations** rather than software implementations, because in college teachers ask for this stuff.
